============= doing builds ====
NOTE! FOR WEB SERVICE RELATED CHANGES, THE POM.XML FILE 
IN THE ..\PORTAL\WEBSERVICECLIENT FOLDER WILL NEED TO
HAVE THE WSDL PROPERTIES POINT TO LOCALHOST, OR A SERVER
THAT HAS THE NEWEST CHANGES ON IT.

*************** do the INT1 environment first as a SMOKE TEST *****************

login to jenkins for building (isrk / CSOadmin)

test and app build tab , FOR ALL CENTERS run "driver build" AND "driver test"
test and app build tab , FOR ONE CENTER run "CENTER driver test"  THEN "CENTER driver build" example, run PolicyCenterTest THEN PolicyCenterApplicationBuild



putty to vm-gwbuild for deploying
cd /srv/DeployAndRestart
./deploy.sh pc rat3 lastSuccessful

============ cso portal log path =================
/var/log/tomcat6/CsoPortal.log

/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/compsource-portal-webui-stripes/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
--------------------- logging.properties file locations -------
/srv/tomcat/cc/webapps/.. there are two under here
------------------------------------------------
============= ldap ===============

to clone, You'll need to import compsourceok.ldif and admin.ldif, in that order. 

machine url is vm-gwportaldev1.s-i-f.local

The pid location is -- /var/lib/apacheds-2.0.0-M15/default/run/

The file is apacheds-default.pid

To start it, run: /etc/init.d/apacheds-2.0.0-M15-default start 


THE PORTAL INSTANCE WILL HAVE TO BE RESTARTED IF THE LDAP SERVER GOES DOWN

http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/basic-ug/1.4.3-adding-partition.html

=========== cms related paths ====================

/srv/csd/cms/query/request

C:\srv\csd\cms\submission\response\ToProcess  (claim input files)
	
/srv/tomcat/cc/conf/resources/properties/cms.properties
/tmp/gwlogs/claimcenter/logs/plugins/cms.log

To process e2e locally, point your claimcenter config.xml entry to e2e, as well as point the db.properties INT1 entry to e2e

========== tomcat =========
/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps
/etc/tomcat
/srv/tomcat/cc/logs
/srv/tomcat/cc/webapps/cc/modules/configuration/config/config.xml -- where the db stuff is located

============================== setting up for a new portal instance =================
to see what's happening during process, look in /var/log/tomcat6 for logging files

a couple of portal urls:

http://rat3portal.s-i-f.local:8080/
http://rat2portal.s-i-f.local:8080/
+++++++++++
found the issue. there are a couple of directories that get cloned,
that have to have their names changed for the specific instance.

For example when cloning from rat3, the clone has a folder
/usr/share/tomcat6/conf/Catalina/rat3portal.s-i-f.local, and
I needed to rename it to /usr/share/tomcat6/conf/Catalina/rat2portal.s-i-f.local.
++++++++++++++++++++
Here's how to find the folders that need to be renamed after cloning
find / -type d -name "rat*" -print
/etc/tomcat6/Catalina/rat2portal.s-i-f.local
/var/cache/tomcat6/work/Catalina/rat2portal.s-i-f.local
/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/rat2portal.s-i-f.local
-------------------

I’m making notes as I go!

We need to do the new ldaps, so I’m reading up on how to set one up.
I’m going to email Roger a question about some files that he provided
that are related to configuring apacheds.

uid=admin,o=compsourceok,dc=com / Password1

 /etc/init.d/apacheds-2.0.0-M15-default start | stop


cd to /usr/share/tomcat6/conf/Catalina

 mkdir rat3portal.s-i-f.local
 
 after deploy there will be a file ROOT.xml, need to do :  chmod u=rw,go=r ROOT.xml
 
 cd to /usr/share/tomcat6/webapps
 
 mkdir rat3portal.s-i-f.local
 
  cd to /usr/share/tomcat6/conf
  
  make sure server.xml has a <host> entry for the new instance
  
  make sure owner of the webapps folder is tomcat:
  
   chown tomcat rat3portal.s-i-f.local/
  
  starting and stopping tomcat:
  
  /etc/init.d/tomcat6 restart
  /etc/init.d/tomcat6 start
  /etc/init.d/tomcat6 stop
  
  on Rat3, my user name is ron
on Rat2, my user name is ron1  
 
eeportal.s-i-f.local

============= web service dev ================
If you need to add/change parameters in a guidewire service,
run regen-wsi-local
